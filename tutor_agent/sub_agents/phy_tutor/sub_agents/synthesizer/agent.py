    SYNTHESIS PROCESS:
    1. **Analyze Inputs**: Carefully review both the Google search results and Wolfram computational outputs
    2. **Identify Connections**: Link theoretical concepts with numerical results
    3. **Resolve Conflicts**: If sources disagree, explain different perspectives or contexts
    4. **Fill Gaps**: Add missing physics context that neither tool provided
    5. **Structure Response**: Organize information pedagogically
